There are several methods to convert the Markdown to PDF. For example:

- https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
- https://classic.markdowntopdf.com/ (unauthenticated)
- https://classic.markdowntopdf.com/ (with default style)
- https://classic.markdowntopdf.com/ (with Resume style)

Unfortunately, due to changes on Markdown to PDF, I cannot reproduce the original style that was used previously. The best current option is to use https://classic.markdowntopdf.com/ without authenticating.
