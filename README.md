Hi! I'm a computer science student attending the University of Waterloo.

I love learning new things from different people. I think understanding how people live, work and play is the first step to making their world a better place, one line of code at a time.

Here, you can find my current resum√©. You can see my side projects and some fun hacks [on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/RevolutionTech).

Please feel free to check out [my portfolio website](http://revolutiontech.ca) as well.
